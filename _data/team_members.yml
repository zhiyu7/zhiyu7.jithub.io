  info: Computational associate jointly with Dr. Michael Honigberg
  bio: Linke Li holds a Master's degree in Biostatistics from Duke University. Her research focuses on integrating deep learning methodologies into statistical genetics to enhance disease risk prediction and identify at-risk populations. She is interested in comparing the disease prediction capabilities of deep learning methods with traditional approaches like genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and polygenic risk scores (PRS). By identifying novel genetic variations, she aims to improve risk prediction models and contribute to preventive healthcare for disease.
