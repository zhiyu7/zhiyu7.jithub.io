### Computational Multi-omics for Age-related Diseases

Our research focuses on **computational modeling of human multi-omics** data to uncover the mechanisms driving cardiovascular and other age-related diseases, aiming to identify personalized strategies for disease prevention and treatment.

Key areas of interest:

- Age-related **clonal hematopoiesis** (CH; somatic mutations in the blood-forming system) and its **somatic-germline interplay**, with implications for managing CH-associated diseases.

- **Omics-based** instruments for testing **causal hypothesis** in studying diseases.

- **Disease risk prediction** using static (germline genetic) and dynamic (time-varying fators) data (in collaboration with <a href="https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/jin-jin-0" target="_blank">Dr. Jin Jin</a>).

- Machine learning + proteomics for drug discovery (in collaboration with <a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/ahmed-alaa" target="_blank">Dr. Ahmed Alaa</a>). 

- Deep learning-derived phenotypes + genetics for understanding diseases (in collaboration with <a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/180872" target="_blank">Dr. Vineet Raghu</a>). 

Our research is largely strengthened by the extensive human and murine datasets we have access to, and we are deeply grateful to our collaborators and cohort PIs for their trust.
